-------------------------------------------------
||   Steps to follow after updating the code   ||
-------------------------------------------------

Step-0:

1. Edit the code as you like.

Make sure that-
2. you are using an anaconda virutal environment named 'msdlib' (optional)
3. dependencies are installed from both requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt
4. pytorch is installed properly


Step-1:

Do not forget to update the version number inside msdlib/__init__.py


Step-2:

Code documentation:

1. make necessary changes in code documentation


Step-3:

Code testing:

1. run pytest
    command: coverage run -m pytest tests/ --html=tests/test-report-<date>.html
2. run coverage using command: coverage html


Step-4:

Running example files through one command:

1. Be in project directory in the command line.
2. command: python utils/run_examples.py (at first, make sure there is an anaconda envirornment named msdlib where you have installed everything)


Step-5:

Update README before pushing or updating on pypi

1. Be in project directory in the command line.
2. command: python utils/update_readme.py (at first, make sure there is an anaconda envirornment named msdlib where you have installed everything)


Step-6:

Code documentation integration using Sphinx

1. go to docs
2. type command: make html
3. push the code to github (not yet, do below steps after the code is pushed to github in Step-7)
4. go to the website of readthedocs and log in
5. go to the builds section
6. press on build button for a new build
done!!

Step-7:

1. Check git diff for each updated file
2. After checking is done, Commit and Push to github


Step-8:

pypi build and upload commands

1. python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
2. python -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
username: __token__
pass: use the account token
