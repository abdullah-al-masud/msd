mlutils
=======

This module is intended to procide support for easy usage of pytorch models. 
It provides support for using Pytorch models in a few lines of code, has similar (not exactly same) functionalities as scikit-learn models. 
We can train the model using simple 'fit' method, can generate predictions using 'predict' method and can evaluate model performance using 'evaluate' method.

It can also enable us to build Deep Neural Network models easily with some other helper functions.
