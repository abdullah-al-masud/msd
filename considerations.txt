Things to to-

- adding data loader utilization for evaluate function in torchModel (done)
- Batch size isnt necessary when using dataloader for torchModel (done)
- Documentation needs to be fixed (done)
- importation of pytorch should not be mandatory where only helper functions are to be used with other models (done)
- replace DataParallel with DistributedDataParallel for parallelization
- adding more test cases for better code coverage
- adding more example scripts for making sure that functions are working properly
